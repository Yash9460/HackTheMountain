To develop a platform that allows programming students to share their work experience and projects with other younger students.

# Problem

1)Lack of funds:- our website is free of cost platform to learn and code 

2)Wastage of resources:- since most of the courses are very good but due to lack of information these courses don't get the shoutout but on our website, you will find all important courses.

3)Mass illeteracy:- our website is for everyone even the most experienced person can share their experiences with us so that juniors get the help to find out their path

# Solution

Build an website or online platform which programming students can use to capture their work-based experiences and share these learning experiences with other students through text, photos, or videos.

The focus is to develop a platform that allows programming students to share their work experiences and projects with other younger students.

Education is the means by which a person can have a happy and successful life. It helps us to recognize our hidden skills and talents, using which we can build our career, gain employment and have a secured future.

- This website also includes a voicebot, named "Jenifer", which helps to user to tell about the courses present in website, tell about the courses and best online platforms for learning about that courses.
